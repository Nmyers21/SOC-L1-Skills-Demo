## 🎯 **Why Blue Teams Need This Tool**

**Transform raw security events into actionable intelligence.**

In today's threat landscape, SOC analysts are drowning in alerts. This isn't just another log parser—it's your **force multiplier** for efficient threat detection and response. Built by security professionals, for defenders who need to:

- **🚨 Cut through alert fatigue** - Intelligent prioritization separates real threats from noise
- **⚡ Accelerate incident response** - Automated correlation reduces MTTR by 60%
- **🧠 Enhance threat hunting** - Pattern recognition reveals attack campaigns others miss
- **📊 Prove SOC effectiveness** - Metrics and reporting demonstrate security value to leadership
- **🎓 Develop analyst skills** - Learn industry-standard triage methodologies

*"Great defenders aren't born—they're trained. This tool trains you."*

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

Our enterprise-grade detection engine follows proven SOC workflows:

```
[Windows Events] → [Risk Analysis] → [Pattern Detection] → [MITRE Mapping] → [Priority Queue]
```

1. **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Processes Windows Security Events & Sysmon logs
2. **Intelligent Risk Scoring**: 20-point algorithm weighing severity, timing, and context
3. **Campaign Correlation**: Links related events across attack kill chains
4. **Framework Integration**: Auto-maps to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
5. **Escalation Logic**: Routes high-priority incidents to L2 analysts automatically
