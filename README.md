Security Analysis Features
Event Processing
The system analyzes multiple types of security events:

Failed Authentication (Event ID 4625) - Potential brute force attacks
Successful Logons (Event ID 4624) - Account access monitoring
Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672) - Privilege escalation detection
Account Creation (Event ID 4720) - Persistence mechanism identification
Process Creation (Event ID 4688) - Suspicious execution monitoring

Risk Scoring Algorithm
Multi-factor analysis considers:

Event Severity - Based on Windows Event ID significance
Source Analysis - Internal vs external IP assessment
Account Context - Administrative vs standard user evaluation
Temporal Patterns - Business hours vs off-hours activity
Correlation Factors - Cross-event attack pattern detection

Attack Pattern Detection
Brute Force Attacks

Threshold: 5+ failed authentication attempts
Analysis: Source IP, target accounts, timing patterns
MITRE Mapping: T1110.001 (Password Guessing)

Privilege Escalation

Detection: Special privilege assignment to standard users
Context: Related user activity and system access
MITRE Mapping: T1068 (Privilege Escalation)

Lateral Movement

Pattern: User authentication across multiple systems
Analysis: Host count and access patterns
MITRE Mapping: T1021 (Remote Services)
